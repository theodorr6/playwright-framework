## Instructions

This assignment includes two parts:


### Question 1

In this assignment, you will create a script on [Lambdatest's playground](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) using TypeScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. 

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Create a test file in this project to go to [Lambdatest's playground](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/), choose a product list page(e.g. Headphones, Memory Card), sort the list by Price(High > Low) and validate that ALL products are sorted correctly.

You are welcome to install other packages as you see fit, however you must utilize Playwright in this assignment.

### Question 2 - Video Walkthrough (Optional but Encouraged)

You're welcome to use any screen recording tool of your choice (e.g., Loom, OBS, QuickTime). Please share a link to your video if you choose to include this.

## Submission Instructions
